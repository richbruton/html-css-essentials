# Maynooth Coffee CLub

This website is aimed at professional and amateur baristas, as well as coffee enthusiasts. It is for people who wish to both improve their skills and techniques and those who wish to share their ideas and recipes. 

The website will inform them of monthly meetups where they can share ideas, each meetup will have a theme in different areas of coffee preparation. There will be a competition or challenge in the final meet up of each month. 

# Design

This website is design around blocks. Two large screen width blocks sitting over four half screen width blocks.

As screen size gets narrower, the smaller blocks will go form side by side to on below one another.

# Features

The websites feature include; a header with a logo and a navigation bar, a landing image, a briet introduction to the site, a schedule of events, a form to sign up to events and a footer that contains links to social media platforms.

## Navigation bar

The navigation bar sits in the header floated to the right of the logo, as the screen gest smaller it drops below the logo and the font size gets slightly smaller on the smaller screens. The menu allows the user to quikly jump down to a particular section. It will mostly be for returning users who are interested in going straight to that month's schedule or sign up form.

## About Section

The about section sits below the landing image. It is a brief introduction to the site and the purpose of the site. It lets first time visitors know what to expect and to remind returning visitors that they can give back to the group by sharing their knowledge. 

It has a margin on either side to prevent the content looking stringy on a wide screen but as the screen sizes down this margin disappears.

## Meeting Schedule

The meeting schedule, is a table that displays the time, date, location and topic for meetings for the next month. The site currently displays the meetings for February. This will require manual updating each month. 

There is a link to the sign up form that is only visible on smaller devices, as the form can still be hidden at this point.

## Sign up form

The sign up form contains a required first name, a required second name, a required email address, and a radio type selection of events. Initially it was to be a checkbox set of options but that proved difficult to create a required attribute for it using only HTML and CSS. This is something that will be improved on after the site goes live.

## Footer

The footer contains logos of the social media sites, and each one links to the account of the Maynooth Coffee Club for that social media site. On smaller sized devices, the footer is static, this is due to a bug where the logos and links would remain at the bottom of the page and appear invisible against a blank background and the brown background would jump up the page.

## Future features

After a few events have taken place, there will be scope to build a gallery. The gallery will focus on people at the events and the coffees created at the events.
